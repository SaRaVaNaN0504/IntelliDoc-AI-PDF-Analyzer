# üß† IntelliDoc AI: Advanced PDF Analyzer & Q&A Chatbot

![Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)

An intelligent web application built with Python that leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro model to provide sophisticated analysis of PDF documents. IntelliDoc AI can generate multiple types of summaries and hold a detailed, context-aware conversation about the document's content.

## üöÄ About The Project

IntelliDoc AI was designed to solve a common problem: extracting meaningful insights from dense PDF documents quickly and efficiently. Instead of manually reading through pages, users can simply upload a document and let the AI do the heavy lifting. The application provides not just a simple summary, but also a powerful Q&A interface that allows users to "talk" to their documents.

The project features a stunning, fully responsive UI with an animated, glassmorphism-inspired theme, created entirely within Streamlit using custom CSS.

## üîë Key Features

- **Intelligent Summarization**: Generate three distinct types of summaries:
  - üéØ **Concise Summary**: A quick, easy-to-read overview
  - üìö **Section-wise Summary**: A detailed breakdown of each major section
  - ‚Ä¢ **Key Bullet Points**: An extraction of the most critical findings and conclusions

- **Conversational Q&A**: Ask complex questions about the document and receive accurate, context-aware answers generated by the AI

- **Downloadable Content**: Easily download the generated summary as a .txt file

- **Stunning & Responsive UI**: A beautiful, modern interface with animated gradients and glassmorphism effects that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices

- **Secure & Private**: Documents are processed in-memory and are not stored on any server after the session ends
